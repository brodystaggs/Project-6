# Project  6

# Overall
Before starting I wanted to build off of exercise 6b. So it would be easier for me to insert a new model and animation into unity. Then I kind of brain stormed a possible game that would be simple but also kind of goofy. The idea I had was a knight in a castle who had one too many drinks and is looking around for something to eat. In this case he was trying to find cheese. Each cheese has sort of a podium it is on and you interacted with each piece and it hints at another piece. Until, it gives you the location of the exit. Importing textures was simple and easy. Also, importing a different character model and the drunk walk animation was also simple due to building off 6b. I ran into the same issue in this project as exercise 6d. I could not get the character model to interact with anything besides the exit. I watched the exercise videos and it still was not popping up the dialogue I wanted. Besides that the game is pretty straight forward but I still want to try and figure this bug in my code out. I enjoyed this project just the interactive feature was frusterating because I haven't been able to get it to work. Still going to try a fix it!
